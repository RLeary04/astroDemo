    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>
        I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
        page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
    </p>

    <p>
        This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep
        checking back and see how my journey is going!
    </p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>
            I live in {identity.state} and I work as a {identity.occupations[0]}
            and I am also a {identity.occupations[1]}.
        </li>
        {
            identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
                <li>
                    Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{" "}
                    {identity.hobbies[1]}
                </li>
            )
        }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>

    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

    {
        goal === 3 ? (
            <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p>
        ) : (
            <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>
        )
    }
